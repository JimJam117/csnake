Caterpiller is a game like snake, popular on old nokia phones. The obejctive is to eat as much food (red $\sim$) as possible. Each time the player eats food, the caterpillar grows larger, and it becomes harder to avoid the body of the caterpillar. If the player moves into a space taken up by the caterpillar\textquotesingle{}s body, the game ends.
